# Scrape-with-Proxy-
Scraping script that fetches prices on listings from Amazon with the usage of Proxy Rotation and User Agents

# Import File
The import file is merely a list of Amazon skus that correspond to the listings needed to run the scrape on

# Proxy and User Agents
The proxies shown in the script are private proxies purchased on MyPrivateProxy (that no longer works anymore, only used for demonstration) and User Agents are from the website https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/useragents/explore/
